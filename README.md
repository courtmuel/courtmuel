### Hi there 👋 I'm Courtney Mueller

I am currently a full-time student at New Mexico State University majoring in Computer Science. I started my journey into computational sciences in May of 2020 and have become completely immersed into the field and have found each semester becoming increasingly more interesting. I am excited to continue building my coding and practical skills, as well as improve my GitHub and professional profile / portfolio. 


### 🔭 I’m focusing on 👨‍💻

I am currently trying to improve my Python, SQL and C programming. Java is my most well-known language but since I am not using it this semester as much as I have in the past I am working on side projects/challenges to help improve my Java coding skills as well. Although I did not use Java as much this year as my previous years, I am always working to better improve my Java programming skills as well. Lastly, I am also working to finish up my degree and am about to start my last semester.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning

- Currently building a compiler from scratch using C and GAS language(s)
- Learning how to work with multiple people (3+) on a software development project
- Working with game design using Java and Java Swing
